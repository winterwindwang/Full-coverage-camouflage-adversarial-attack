## The official implementation for AAAI2022 paper "FCA Learning a 3D Full-coverage Vehicle Camouflage for Multi view Physical Adversarial Attack"

## Attention!!! The generation process of the face file is [here](https://github.com/winterwindwang/winterwindwang.github.io/blob/master/_posts/tech/2022-05-05-fca-technical-details-face.md)

### Install the following python package before run the code.

> before you running the code, you must install the `neural renderer` python package. You can pull our implementation [here](https://github.com/winterwindwang/neural_renderer), which is slight different to daniilidis.

If there is any question, please contact us without hesitate.

Note that, you code is based on [Yolo-V3](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3) implementation

After train the adversarial camouflage, you can see how camouflage like with the code in src folder.

carasset folder contains some necessary file.

carla_dataset folder contains the dataset, you can reference the carla_dataset/readme.md for detail.
